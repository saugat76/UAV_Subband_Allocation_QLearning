C:\Users\tripats\Documents\GitHub\UAV_Subband_Allocation_QLearning\misc.py:9: DeprecationWarning: loadtxt(): Parsing an integer via a float is deprecated.  To avoid this warning, you can:
    * make sure the original data is stored as integers.
    * use the `converters=` keyword argument.  If you only use
      NumPy 1.23 or later, `converters=float` will normally work.
    * Use `np.loadtxt(...).astype(np.int64)` parsing the file as
      floating point and then convert it.  (On all NumPy versions.)
